git add .

git commit -m "message"

git push origin main

*) Eventhough some changes happen in our application ,sometimes it won't updated in git repository
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in that case ,First we have to remove that folder and again add that same folder

git rm FOLDERNAME

then

git add FOLDERNAME


*)GitHub Arrow on Folder Can't Open
-------------------------------------

Git keeps all of its files in the .git directory.
we have to delete all git files.....sometimes those are hidden
in that case ,we have to delete node modules folder(bcz having git files)

After deleting files also ......sometimes it won't open 
in that case,we have to remove cached files

 git rm --cached FILENAME/FOLDERNAME

 It removes entries from the cache (and even then they may only be marked "removed", internally


 *)Git Remove Remote
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The git remote remove command removes a remote from a local repository.
 
 git remote rm <remote-url>.

 If you remove a remote accidentally, you will need to add it back manually using

 git remote add origin <url>.
