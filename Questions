   Responsive web design ensures a consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

5. **What is a CSS selector?**
   A CSS selector is a pattern used to select and style HTML elements.

6. **What is the box model?**
   The box model describes how elements are displayed in terms of content, padding, borders, and margins.

7. **Explain the difference between margin and padding.**
   Margin is the space outside an element's border, while padding is the space between an element's content and its border.

8. **What is the purpose of media queries in CSS?**
   Media queries allow you to apply styles based on the characteristics of the device or screen size.

9. **What are pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements?**
   Pseudo-classes are used to define the special state of an element (e.g., :hover), while pseudo-elements style a specific part of an element (e.g., ::before).

10. **What is the "box-sizing" property in CSS?**
    The "box-sizing" property controls how the total width and height of an element is calculated, including or excluding padding and borders.

11. **Explain the concept of CSS specificity.**
    Specificity determines which CSS rule gets applied when there are conflicting styles targeting the same element.

12. **What is a flexbox?**
    Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a layout model that arranges elements in a one-dimensional row or column, making it easier to create complex layouts.

13. **What is a CSS grid?**
    CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows for more complex and flexible grid layouts.

14. **What is the "display" property in CSS used for?**
    The "display" property defines how an element is displayed, and it can be used to change an element's layout behavior.

15. **How do you center an element horizontally and vertically in CSS?**
    Horizontally: `margin: 0 auto;` or flexbox/grid centering. Vertically: Flexbox alignment properties or using transform.

16. **What is a CSS preprocessor?**
    A CSS preprocessor (e.g., Sass, Less) extends CSS with features like variables, nesting, and mixins to make styling more efficient.

17. **What is a CSS framework?**
    A CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Foundation) provides a set of pre-designed and pre-styled components to speed up web development.

18. **What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?**
    The DOM represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, enabling scripts to interact with and manipulate HTML and XML content.

19. **What is the purpose of AJAX?**
    AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allows you to update parts of a web page without requiring a full page reload.

20. **Explain the same-origin policy in JavaScript.**
    The same-origin policy restricts scripts from making requests to a different domain or port for security reasons.

21. **What is a closure in JavaScript?**
    A closure is a function that has access to variables from its containing function, even after that function has finished executing.

22. **What is the "this" keyword in JavaScript?**
    "this" refers to the current execution context and is used to access properties and methods within that context.

23. **What is event delegation?**
    Event delegation is a technique where a single event handler is placed on a common ancestor element to handle events for its descendants.

24. **How does hoisting work in JavaScript?**
    Hoisting is the process of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their containing scope during compilation.

25. **What is the purpose of "strict mode" in JavaScript?**
    Strict mode enforces a stricter parsing and error handling of JavaScript code, catching common mistakes and improving overall code quality.

26. **What is a callback function?**
    A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function and is executed when a certain event occurs or a task is completed.

27. **Explain the "event loop" in JavaScript.**
    The event loop is a mechanism that handles asynchronous operations in JavaScript, ensuring non-blocking behavior.

28. **What are Promises in JavaScript?**
    Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations and provide a cleaner alternative to nested callback functions.

29. **What is the purpose of the "async/await" syntax?**
    "async/await" simplifies asynchronous code by allowing you to write asynchronous operations in a more synchronous-looking style.

30. **What is a Single Page Application (SPA)?**
    A Single Page Application is a web application that dynamically updates a single HTML page, providing a smoother user experience.

31. **What is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)?**
    CORS is a security feature that allows or restricts web pages to make requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.

32. **What are Web Components?**
    Web Components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create custom, reusable, and encapsulated HTML elements.

33. **What is lazy loading in the context of web development?**
    Lazy loading is a technique used to defer the loading of non-critical resources until they are actually needed, improving page load performance.

34. **What is the purpose of a "data-" attribute in HTML?**
    "data-" attributes provide a way to store custom data private to the page or application that's not tied to a particular element's functionality.

35. **Explain the "viewport" meta tag.**
    The "viewport" meta tag allows you to control how a webpage is displayed on different devices by setting the initial scale and width.

36. **What is a front-end build tool?**
    A front-end build tool (e.g., Webpack, Gulp) automates tasks like minification, bundling, and transpilation to enhance development workflow.

37. **What is the purpose of WebAssembly?**
    WebAssembly is a binary instruction format designed to improve the performance of web applications, enabling languages other than JavaScript to run in browsers.

38. **What is Progressive Web App (PWA)?**
    A Progressive Web App is a type of web application that offers a native app-like experience through features like offline access and push notifications.

39. **What are browser Developer Tools?**
    Developer Tools are built-in tools in web browsers that help developers inspect, debug, and profile web applications.

40. **What is the purpose of a "favicon"?**
    A favicon is a small icon associated with a website that appears in the browser's tab or bookmarks bar.

41. **Explain the concept of minification.**
    Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters like white spaces and comments

 from code to reduce its size and improve loading times.

42. **What is the "localStorage" and "sessionStorage" APIs used for?**
    Both APIs provide a way to store key-value pairs in the browser, but "localStorage" data persists across sessions, while "sessionStorage" data is session-specific.

43. **What is the role of a service worker?**
    A service worker is a script that runs in the background and helps manage caching, push notifications, and other browser features for web applications.

44. **How can you optimize website performance?**
    Optimizing website performance involves techniques like minimizing HTTP requests, using content delivery networks (CDNs), enabling caching, and optimizing images.

45. **What is browser caching?**
    Browser caching is the process of storing static assets like images, scripts, and styles locally in the user's browser to reduce load times for subsequent visits.

46. **Explain the concept of "critical rendering path."**
    The critical rendering path is the sequence of steps a browser takes to convert HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a visual representation on the screen.

47. **What are accessibility best practices in web development?**
    Accessibility best practices ensure that web content is usable by people with disabilities, including using semantic HTML, providing alternative text for images, and maintaining proper color contrast.

48. **What is the difference between "null" and "undefined" in JavaScript?**
    "null" represents an intentional absence of any object value, while "undefined" indicates a variable has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value.

49. **What is the purpose of the "defer" attribute in a script tag?**
    The "defer" attribute delays the execution of a script until after the HTML content has been parsed, helping to improve page load performance.

50. **How does content security policy (CSP) enhance web security?**
    CSP is a security feature that helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by specifying which sources of content are considered valid for a web page.
