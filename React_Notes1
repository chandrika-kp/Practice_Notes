React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.
we can export components two ways 
1) Default export 
-----> export default ComponentName
we came import above file with any name 
like import anyName from './file Path'

2) Named Export
------> export {ComponentName}
we came import above file within curlyBraces {} with same name 
like import {ComponentName} from './file Path' 

------------------>
In a real-time application ,components must deal with dynamic data
Data could be someting internal to the component or may be passed from another component.
To bind the data to the component ,you need two Js objects
1) Props
2)State


Props
----------------------------
React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.
props stands for properties.
props are read only
It allows us to pass data from one component to another component
props are immutable--when parent component update the data that is passed as props then
                     the child component get updated props
props are passed as arguments to function components and accessed within components

steps---->
1) ACCESSING DATA ---- In parent component , this would be accessed as   ( props.property )  // dont forget to pass props as an argument to the function/class component
2) PASSING DATA   ---- we are passing props as a ( property = value ) to child component.


State
-----------------------------
The state is an initial value set for a component, which is used for interactivity.
The state is the set of data that is managed by the component.
